      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am Razia Sultana Makey. I'm studying in Computer Programming in
        Seneca College. We are going to create an eCommerce web app in WEB322 
        which will be updating and modifying throughout this course.

        I am really interested in pursuing a degree in computer programming.
        I have  always been fascinated by how technology works and the 
        problem-solving nature of coding. I enjoy the logical thinking required 
        to develop software and the endless possibilities it offers for innovation. 
        As I am truly passionate about computer programming, I am eager to dive deeper
        into the subject. I can't wait to learn from experienced professors, collaborate
        with like-minded peers, and engage in hands-on projects that challenge and inspire me.
      </p>

        I would like to see myself working as a software developer or software engineer in
        the future. Studying computer programming in college will provide me with the necessary skills,
        knowledge, and industry connections to pursue a successful career in the technology sector.
